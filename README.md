## Getting Started

To get started with the assignments, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ashfaqfardin/Numerical-Method-Assignments.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Numerical-Method-Assignments
   ```

3. Open the desired Jupyter Notebook file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

4. Read the assignment instructions and problem statements within the notebook.

5. Implement the solution code based on the given problem statement.

6. Test your solution with different inputs to verify its correctness.

7. Submit your solution as per the instructions provided.

8. Repeat steps 3-7 for other assignments as needed.
